# CI/CD Workflow Compliance Report

## 📋 Compliance Analysis Complete

The GitHub CI/CD workflow (`ci-cd.yml`) has been thoroughly analyzed and updated to ensure full compliance with the project structure, technical design document, and coding rules.

## ✅ Key Compliance Updates Made

### 1. **Flutter Version Alignment**
- **Updated**: Flutter version from `3.24.0` to `3.35.3` to match the current project environment
- **Compliance**: Matches the actual Flutter version used in the project (`flutter --version`)

### 2. **Project Structure Validation**
- **Added**: Comprehensive project structure verification step
- **Validates**: All required directories from clean architecture:
  - `lib/core/constants`, `lib/core/themes`, `lib/core/router`
  - `lib/data/models`, `lib/data/repositories`
  - `lib/features`, `lib/widgets`
  - `test/unit`, `test/widget`, `test/integration`
- **Compliance**: Follows technical design document architecture requirements

### 3. **Code Generation Integration**
- **Added**: Hive and JSON code generation using `build_runner`
- **Included**: In all build jobs (validate, build-android, build-web)
- **Compliance**: Essential for the offline-first Hive database architecture specified in TDD

### 4. **Enhanced Testing Strategy**
- **Improved**: Test execution with coverage reporting
- **Added**: Separate execution of unit, widget, and integration tests
- **Added**: Test coverage artifact upload
- **Compliance**: Follows testing strategy outlined in technical design document

### 5. **Conventional Commit Validation**
- **Added**: Commit message format validation for pull requests
- **Enforces**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:` prefixes
- **Compliance**: Aligns with coding rules for commit message conventions

### 6. **Security Audit Implementation**
- **Added**: Security checks for sensitive files (*.key, *.pem, *.p12)
- **Added**: GitGuardian integration for comprehensive secret detection
- **Validates**: `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive folders (`.qoder/`)
- **Comprehensive**: Full repository history scanning with all policies
- **Compliance**: Follows repository setup and file exclusion rules from experience memory

### 7. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**
- **Android**: Multi-architecture APK builds (arm, arm64, x64) for release
- **Web**: CanvasKit renderer for better performance
- **Verification**: Build output validation with `ls -la` commands
- **Compliance**: Optimizes for cross-platform deployment as specified in TDD

### 8. **Enhanced Reporting and Summaries**
- **Improved**: Detailed job summaries with status indicators
- **Added**: Coverage reporting, generated files count
- **Added**: Security audit status and GitGuardian results in summaries
- **Added**: Dedicated security job with comprehensive reporting
- **Compliance**: Provides comprehensive workflow visibility

### 9. **Artifact Management**
- **Organized**: Test coverage, APK, and web build artifacts
- **Configurable**: Retention periods via repository variables
- **Named**: Branch-specific artifact naming
- **Compliance**: Follows deployment and artifact management best practices

### 10. **Working Directory Consistency**
- **Verified**: All jobs use correct working directory (`./`)
- **Aligned**: With actual project structure (root directory)
- **Compliance**: Matches project layout and avoids path issues
