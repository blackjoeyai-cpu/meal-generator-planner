# Data Directory

This directory contains data assets for the Meal Generator Planner application.

## Structure
- `meals.json` - Default meal data for the application
- `categories.json` - Food categories and classifications
- `ingredients.json` - Common ingredients database
- `sample_data/` - Sample data for testing and development

## Usage
Data files are loaded using:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

final String data = await rootBundle.loadString('assets/data/meals.json');
```

## Format
All data files should be in JSON format with proper structure according to the data models defined in `/lib/data/models/`.

## Offline-First Design
These data files support the offline-first architecture by providing local data when no internet connection is available.
